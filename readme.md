# Fun Max/MSP patches to mess up your sound

## 1.Cycle Chopper

Inport a sample of a pitches sound. The patch will analyse the waveform and find the repeating cycle by detecting when the waveform touches the 'zero'. You can export that cycle for your waveform synths or you can resample it and save it as a file. The patch also has a nice visual feedback and some extra features, like saving segments instead of cycles.
